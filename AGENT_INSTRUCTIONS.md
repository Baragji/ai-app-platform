# Copilot Agent Operating Contract

You must:

- Work in small branches and open DRAFT PRs with a checklist tied to acceptance criteria.
- Keep CI green; if you break a check, fix it before requesting review.
- Never add secrets to code or CI. Use env placeholders and document them.
- Prefer minimal, auditable changes. Explain root cause in `docs/*`.
- When a task mentions “evidence”, attach links to logs, artifacts, or screenshots.
