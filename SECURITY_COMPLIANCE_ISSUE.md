# Security & Supply Chain Compliance - Complete Evidence Bundle

**Issue Type**: Epic  
**Labels**: `phase-5`, `compliance`, `security`, `supply-chain`  
**Priority**: High  
**Milestone**: Phase 5 - Production Readiness

## Overview

This issue addresses Phase 5.1 Security & Supply Chain requirements to create a complete security evidence bundle for the AI App Platform. This encompasses ASVS v5.0 compliance evidence, enhanced SBOM generation with CycloneDX 1.6, SLSA v1.0 provenance, and comprehensive compliance documentation.

## Problem Statement

As an AI application platform preparing for production deployment, we need comprehensive security and supply chain compliance documentation to:

1. **Meet Regulatory Requirements**: EU AI Act, GDPR, and sector-specific compliance
2. **Ensure Supply Chain Security**: Complete visibility into dependencies and build processes
3. **Enable Security Auditing**: Provide evidence for security assessments and certifications
4. **Support Risk Management**: Identify and mitigate security and compliance risks
5. **Establish Trust**: Demonstrate security posture to users and stakeholders

## Current State Assessment
