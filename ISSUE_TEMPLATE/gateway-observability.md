# Gateway Observability

## Description
This issue tracks the implementation of comprehensive observability for the AI Gateway with metrics endpoints, enhanced Langfuse integration, and a complete metrics dashboard.

## Definition of Done
- Complete metrics dashboard with real-time performance, cost tracking, and provider health monitoring
- `/metrics` endpoint (Prometheus-compatible) and enhanced `/health` endpoint
- Enhanced Langfuse integration with cost attribution and performance correlation
- â‰¥90% test coverage with performance benchmarks
