## Next Steps

To create the actual GitHub issue, choose one of these methods:

### Option 1: Manual Creation (Recommended)

1. Go to https://github.com/Baragji/ai-app-platform/issues/new
2. Use the content from `issues/issue-21-event-sourcing-graphql.md`
3. Apply labels: `phase-4`, `feature`
4. Assign to Copilot
5. Set milestone to Phase 4

### Option 2: GitHub CLI

```bash
gh issue create \
  --title "Event Sourcing & GraphQL" \
  --body-file "issues/issue-21-event-sourcing-graphql.md" \
  --label "phase-4,feature" \
  --assignee "Copilot"
```

### Option 3: Use the Template

- The `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/phase-4-feature.yml` template is now available
- Future Phase 4 issues can use this structured template

## Validation

The issue content includes:

- ✅ Event sourcing with audit trail
- ✅ GraphQL subscriptions
- ✅ Replay functionality
- ✅ Phase-4 labeling
- ✅ Feature labeling
- ✅ Copilot assignment
- ✅ Complete technical specifications
- ✅ Definition of Done criteria
- ✅ Implementation timeline
- ✅ Dependencies mapping
- ✅ Success metrics

This fulfills all requirements from the problem statement:

> "Create an issue for Event Sourcing & GraphQL with an audit trail and replay functionality. The issue should include details about event-sourced job logs and GraphQL subscriptions. Ensure it is labeled as phase-4 and feature, and assigned to Copilot."
