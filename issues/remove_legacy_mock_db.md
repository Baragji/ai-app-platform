### Issue: Remove Legacy Mock Database

#### Description:

Remove the legacy in-memory mock database file and ensure all database operations use the real Prisma client.

#### Background:

The `apps/web/src/lib/db.ts` file contained an in-memory mock database that conflicted with proper Prisma usage. This issue tracks the removal of this legacy component and validation that all imports use the real Prisma client.

#### Tasks:

- [x] Search for imports of `@/src/lib/db` or `@/lib/db`
- [x] Delete the `apps/web/src/lib/db.ts` file
- [x] Audit all database imports to ensure they use `@ai-app-platform/db`
- [x] Verify no mock database references remain in codebase

#### Files Affected:

- ~~`apps/web/src/lib/db.ts`~~ (deleted)
- All API routes using database imports
- Authentication system imports

#### Definition of Done:

- [x] No runtime imports of the in-memory DB
- [x] Only real Prisma client is used throughout the application
- [x] All database operations go through `@ai-app-platform/db` package
- [x] No references to mock database patterns remain

#### Status:

**COMPLETED** âœ…

This task has been verified as complete. The legacy mock database file has been removed and all database operations now use the real Prisma client from the `@ai-app-platform/db` package.

#### Verification Evidence:

- `apps/web/src/lib/db.ts` file does not exist
- All database imports use `import { prisma } from '@ai-app-platform/db';`
- No mock database references found in codebase search
- Production Readiness Plan documents this as completed
