# OpenSSF Scorecard Security Analysis

This document describes the OpenSSF Scorecard integration for the AI App Platform and how to interpret the results.

## Overview

[OpenSSF Scorecard](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard) is an automated security tool that evaluates open source projects for supply chain security risks. It provides a score from 0-10 based on various security practices and policies.

## Integration

The Scorecard analysis runs automatically:

- **On Pull Requests**: Every PR targeting `main` or `develop` branches
- **Nightly**: Daily at 2 AM UTC on the `main` branch
- **Manual**: Can be triggered manually via workflow dispatch

## Scoring Criteria

Scorecard evaluates projects based on these security practices:

### Binary Artifacts (Weight: High)

- **Purpose**: Checks if the project uses binary artifacts that could be malicious
- **Best Practice**: Avoid checking in binary files; build from source

### Branch Protection (Weight: High)

- **Purpose**: Ensures critical branches are protected from unauthorized changes
- **Best Practice**: Require PR reviews, status checks, and restrict force pushes

### CI Tests (Weight: High)

- **Purpose**: Verifies that the project runs tests in CI/CD
- **Best Practice**: Comprehensive test suite with high coverage

### CII Best Practices (Weight: High)

- **Purpose**: Checks if project follows Core Infrastructure Initiative best practices
- **Best Practice**: Achieve CII Best Practices badge

### Code Review (Weight: High)

- **Purpose**: Ensures code changes are reviewed before merging
- **Best Practice**: Require approvals from code owners

### Contributors (Weight: High)

- **Purpose**: Evaluates diversity of contributors and organizations
- **Best Practice**: Multiple contributors from different organizations

### Dangerous Workflow (Weight: Critical)

- **Purpose**: Identifies GitHub workflows that could be exploited
- **Best Practice**: Avoid `pull_request_target` with checkout

### Dependency Update Tool (Weight: High)

- **Purpose**: Checks if automated dependency updates are configured
- **Best Practice**: Use Dependabot, Renovate, or similar tools

### Fuzzing (Weight: Medium)

- **Purpose**: Verifies if the project uses fuzzing for testing
- **Best Practice**: Integrate fuzzing tools like OSS-Fuzz

### License (Weight: Medium)

- **Purpose**: Ensures project has a proper open source license
- **Best Practice**: Include standard license file

### Maintained (Weight: High)

- **Purpose**: Evaluates if the project is actively maintained
- **Best Practice**: Regular commits, issue responses, releases

### Packaging (Weight: Medium)

- **Purpose**: Checks if project is available through package managers
- **Best Practice**: Publish to npm, PyPI, Maven Central, etc.

### Pinned Dependencies (Weight: Medium)

- **Purpose**: Verifies if dependencies are pinned to specific versions
- **Best Practice**: Pin GitHub Actions and container image tags

### SAST (Weight: Medium)

- **Purpose**: Checks if static analysis security testing is used
- **Best Practice**: Integrate CodeQL, SonarCloud, or similar tools

### Security Policy (Weight: Medium)

- **Purpose**: Ensures project has a security vulnerability disclosure policy
- **Best Practice**: Include SECURITY.md file

### Signed Releases (Weight: High)

- **Purpose**: Verifies if releases are cryptographically signed
- **Best Practice**: Sign releases with GPG or Sigstore

### Token Permissions (Weight: High)

- **Purpose**: Checks if GitHub tokens have minimal necessary permissions
- **Best Practice**: Use specific permissions, avoid `write-all`

### Vulnerabilities (Weight: Critical)

- **Purpose**: Identifies known vulnerabilities in dependencies
- **Best Practice**: Keep dependencies updated, use security scanning

### Webhooks (Weight: Medium)

- **Purpose**: Ensures webhooks use proper authentication
- **Best Practice**: Use webhook secrets for authentication

## Results Interpretation

### Score Ranges

- **8.0-10.0**: Excellent security posture
- **6.0-7.9**: Good security practices with room for improvement
- **4.0-5.9**: Moderate security practices, several improvements needed
- **2.0-3.9**: Poor security practices, significant improvements required
- **0.0-1.9**: Very poor security practices, urgent attention needed

### Issue Severity Levels

- **ðŸ”´ Critical**: High-risk issues that should be addressed immediately
- **ðŸŸ¡ High**: Important issues that should be prioritized
- **ðŸ”µ Medium**: Moderate issues that should be addressed over time

## Viewing Results

### GitHub Security Tab

1. Navigate to the repository on GitHub
2. Click on the "Security" tab
3. Select "Code scanning alerts"
4. Filter by "Scorecard" to see Scorecard-specific results

### Workflow Artifacts

1. Go to the "Actions" tab in the repository
2. Find the latest "OpenSSF Scorecard" workflow run
3. Download the "scorecard-results" artifact
4. Extract and view the SARIF file for detailed results

### PR Comments

When Scorecard runs on a PR, it will automatically post a comment with:

- Overall score
- Count of issues by severity
- Links to detailed results

## Improving Your Score

### Quick Wins

1. **Add SECURITY.md**: Create a security policy file
2. **Enable Branch Protection**: Protect main branches
3. **Pin Dependencies**: Use specific versions for GitHub Actions
4. **Add License**: Include a proper open source license

### Medium-term Improvements

1. **Setup Dependabot**: Enable automated dependency updates
2. **Add More Tests**: Increase test coverage
3. **Enable CodeQL**: Add static analysis security testing
4. **Sign Releases**: Implement release signing

### Long-term Goals

1. **CII Best Practices**: Work toward CII badge
2. **Fuzzing Integration**: Add fuzz testing
3. **Multiple Contributors**: Grow contributor base
4. **Package Distribution**: Publish to package managers

## Best Practices for Maintaining High Scores

### Repository Setup

- Enable branch protection with required reviews
- Set up automated security scanning (CodeQL, Dependabot)
- Create comprehensive documentation (README, SECURITY.md, CONTRIBUTING.md)

### Development Workflow

- Require code reviews for all changes
- Use automated testing in CI/CD
- Pin dependencies to specific versions
- Regularly update dependencies

### Security Practices

- Implement security vulnerability disclosure process
- Sign releases and commits when possible
- Use minimal necessary permissions for automation
- Regularly audit and update security practices

### Community Building

- Encourage diverse contributors
- Respond promptly to issues and PRs
- Maintain active development and releases
- Foster inclusive and welcoming community

## Monitoring and Alerts

The Scorecard workflow provides several monitoring mechanisms:

1. **Nightly Runs**: Track score changes over time
2. **PR Analysis**: Catch security regressions early
3. **GitHub Security Tab**: Centralized view of all security issues
4. **Workflow Artifacts**: Detailed analysis data for deep investigation

## Integration with Other Tools

Scorecard results can be integrated with:

- **Security Dashboards**: Import SARIF results
- **Compliance Systems**: Track security metrics
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Gate deployments based on scores
- **Alerting Systems**: Notify on score degradation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Low Score Despite Good Practices**

- Scorecard may not detect all security measures
- Some checks require specific file names or locations
- Historical data affects some scoring algorithms

**False Positives**

- Review detailed SARIF results for context
- Some checks may not apply to all project types
- Consider project-specific documentation

**Missing Data**

- Ensure GitHub repository is public or has proper permissions
- Some checks require specific GitHub features to be enabled
- API rate limits may affect some analysis
