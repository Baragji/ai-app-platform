# EU AI Act Compliance Documentation

This directory contains EU AI Act General Purpose AI Model (GPAI) transparency documentation and compliance evidence for the AI App Platform.

## Overview

The EU AI Act is comprehensive legislation that regulates AI systems based on their risk levels. As an AI application platform, we must ensure compliance with relevant provisions, particularly those related to General Purpose AI Models (GPAI) and transparency requirements.

## AI Act Classification

### Current Assessment
- **System Type**: AI Application Platform (orchestrating multiple AI models)
- **Risk Level**: ðŸŸ¡ **Limited Risk** - Subject to transparency obligations
- **GPAI Integration**: âœ… Uses foundation models through API integration
- **User Disclosure**: âœ… Required - users must be informed of AI interaction

### Applicable Provisions

#### Article 50: Transparency Obligations for AI Systems
- **User Notification**: Users must be informed they are interacting with an AI system
- **Clear Disclosure**: Information must be provided in clear and understandable manner
- **Exception Handling**: Does not apply where obvious from context and circumstances

#### Article 52: Additional Transparency for GPAI Systems
- **Model Documentation**: Documentation of capabilities and limitations
- **Transparency Reporting**: Annual reporting on model performance and risks
- **Systemic Risk Assessment**: For models above compute thresholds

## Compliance Implementation

### 1. User Disclosure Requirements

#### Current Implementation
```typescript
// User notification component
const AIDisclosureNotice = () => (
  <div className="ai-disclosure-banner">
    <Icon name="robot" />
    <span>
      This application uses AI models to assist with code generation and analysis.
      All AI-generated content should be reviewed before use.
    </span>
  </div>
);
```
