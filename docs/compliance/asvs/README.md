## Evidence Collection

Each ASVS category has a corresponding evidence file that documents:
- Current implementation status
- Code references and examples
- Test cases and verification steps
- Gaps and remediation plans
- Compliance level achieved (L1, L2, L3)

## Testing and Verification

Security controls are verified through:
- Automated security testing (CodeQL, SAST)
- Manual security testing procedures
- Penetration testing results
- Code review documentation
- CI/CD security gate verification

## Compliance Levels

- **Level 1**: Minimum viable security for all applications
- **Level 2**: Recommended for applications handling sensitive data
- **Level 3**: Required for the most critical applications

## Next Steps

1. Complete security control implementation for Level 1 compliance
2. Document evidence for all implemented controls
3. Perform gap analysis for Level 2 requirements
4. Implement automated testing for all security controls
5. Establish continuous compliance monitoring
